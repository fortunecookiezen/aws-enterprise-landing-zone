## Instructions for executing or building this environment from scratch

1. Create some kind of host to run these scripts from. I shudder at the idea of laptops bootstrapping
public clouds, but it's a *thing*
2. The scripts use profiles, so you need to have those credentials set up. You do have those credentials set up, don't you?

## To Do
* ~Create cft to build initial S3 bucket to host templates~
* Create cli examples of how to bootstrap the process
